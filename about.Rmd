## About Me 
**My name is Zuhair Usmani** and I go to Iroquios Ridge High School. I love to code and everything about it. To me, its very exicting to see your end product when coding.

## About the Project
My project, *Movie & TV Show Genre Trends*, explores the idea of  movies are using the same genres when making the movies and seeing which genres/tags are used the most.

### Goals
To see if Movie Producers are either:

* Genre Spamming
  + Hard to see if its one movie or lots of movies
* Using one genre for every movie
  + Hard to depict all the genres, because there are so many of them
